If you want to see my code, check out my GitHub — I enjoy writing clean, maintainable, and performant code (or at least trying to 😉).

So yeah, how can I help *you* today? Need to bounce ideas, review architecture, debug something annoying, or just connect with another dev in the field?

Drop me a line!
